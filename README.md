This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when developing Node.js HTTP servers: the 'EADDRINUSE' error.  This error occurs when the server attempts to bind to a port that is already in use by another process.  The `bug.js` file shows the error-causing code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a solution.
